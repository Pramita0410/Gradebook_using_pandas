# Pandas Gradebook Project

This project uses Python and pandas to create a gradebook application for managing student performance. It processes student data, calculates scores, and generates final grades for each student.

## Features

- **Data Processing:** Reads and merges rosters, quizzes, homework, and exam data from CSV files.
- **Grade Calculation:** Computes scores using weighted averages for quizzes, homework, and exams.
- **Final Grades:** Assigns letter grades (`A` to `F`) based on calculated scores.
- **Export:** Outputs final gradebooks in CSV format.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the `main.ipynb` notebook to process data and generate gradebooks.
3. Find the final gradebooks saved as CSV files in the `data/` directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
